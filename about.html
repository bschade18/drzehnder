              For me, there was never one defining moment where I knew I was
              going to become a practicing physician but it has been nudges in
              the direction of the vocation I desire. From an early age my
              cousin-in-law Dr. Berend was one of my role models and I was
              probably biased since he did cool things like sit on the bench at
              Duke basketball games. However, for me I was not thinking at the
              time much about a career but more about being able to shoot hoops
              in my driveway until my mom turned the lights out on me or playing
              backyard football with my neighborhood friends. Sports were life,
              life was sports.

              It continued this way into high school where at times I would
              excel in school in a subject but my eyes were set on achieving an
              athletic scholarship in football. I loved the game and while I
              knew I was not going to play professionally I hoped that it would
              lead me into college into some kind of career field. I shadowed
              parents, friend’s parents and took career assessments which listed
              jobs like carpet upholstery and things that I feel like were not
              in my skillset. I also tested the waters and sent out applications
              at schools where I thought had cool names and locations: NYU,
              Pepperdine, etc. After attending visits to Butler and Princeton
              for football and glancing at Lehigh University in my heart I knew
              that I was not going to have a future in college football. I began
              thinking about how I could channel my time and efforts from sports
              into developing a career. It was when I chose to pursue Miami U
              for the Chinese business program where I started my collegiate
              experience. When that first semester did not go as planned, I
              decided to return home to Ohio State. I took a few classes and was
              able to work my way into the honors Business program, but there is
              one thing that distinctly sticks out. I had an advising meeting
              and it involved what I needed to do to get into the honors
              business program and laid out four years worth of classes. I asked
              my advisor to show me what it would look like if I decided that I
              wanted to be pre-medicine. She responded enthusiastically and
              showed me exactly what I needed. Now, it was not in that moment
              that I knew I was going to switch to medicine a year later and go
              on a medical mission trip to south Africa which gave me a
              perspective how wonderful the feeling is to help someone out with
              their health and the reward you gain when they smile and say thank
              you. But, that’s how it turned out. I took a few leaps of faith
              along the way and was able to graduate from the Ohio State
              University with a BA degree in Arts and Sciences in a specialized
              study program for pre-medicine.

            <p>
              I then further advanced my education at Ohio University, where I
              received excellent education in clinical care and medicine
              surrounded by top notch peers in my class. I truly had a wonderful
              experience doing rotations in and around Columbus, OH learning
              from some of the best and brightest faculty preceptors in multiple
              disciplines. I can cite many stories of people I met along the way
              and experiences that shaped my skills and medical knowledge. My
              next stop was a transitional year residency at Unity Health in
              Searcy, Arkansas. As a guy who had a thing for the South, I am
              glad I finally was able to experience the slower pace and
              friendliness of the people. I was able to refine my abilities and
              this is where application of knowledge was finally utilized. I
              grew in understanding on how to be efficient and communicate with
              patients to instill confidence and explain to them their
              treatments. I also realized the responsibility I had to perform
              well and thrived on this opportunity with gratefulness.

          <h3>Goals</h3>
          <p>
            To open an academy for underprivileged, single parent home children
            which is free of charge and encompasses their everyday needs for
            learning, as well as room and board. It also bears the name in honor
            of my parents who tirelessly worked to provide for me the best
            possible future so my desires could match my dreams and my dreams
            could become a reality. Also, to live as long as my grandma who had
            her hip replaced at 103 and lived to be over 103.
